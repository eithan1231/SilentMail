# SilentMail
SilentMail is a simple and easy to use mail server/service. You can configure it as you wish. All source is open, and for the pulic to use, and redistribute at their own will.

# Incomplete
This project is currently incomplete. The actualy Smtp side of things are yet to be uploaded here (they're on my desktop, which i dont currently have access to), and the inteaction between the PHP and C# for sending mail is not yet complete, though most of it is done. Also take the code with a grain of salt, this wasnt a planned project, I just added things as I wanted to. And before you criticize all my mistakes, i have a lot to refector and re-do, which is all in to todo file.

# bugz
